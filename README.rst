Implementation of the Common Lisp's conditions system in Python.

* Free software: BSD license

Rationale
=========

Common Lisp (CL) has a very rich condition system. Conditions in CL is a some sort
of signals, and used not only for exception handling but also in some other patterns.
There is a very good explanation of how they works â€“ a chapter from the book
Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel:
`Beyond Exception Handling: Conditions and Restarts`_.

Python's exceptions cover only one scenerio from this book, but Common Lisp's conditions
allows more interesting usage, particlarly "restarts". Restart is a way to continue
code execution after the exception was signaled, without unwinding a call stack.
I'll repeat: without unwinding a call stack.

Moreover, conditions allows to the author of the library to define varios cases to be
choosen to take over the exception.

Example
-------

Here is example from the book, but implemented in python using `conditions`_ library.



Installation
============

::

    pip install conditions

Documentation
=============

https://python-cl-conditions.readthedocs.org/

Development
===========

To run the all tests run::

    tox

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 90
    :stub-columns: 1

    - - Windows
      - ::

            set PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append
            tox

    - - Other
      - ::

            PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append tox
